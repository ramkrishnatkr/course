% Course details
\textbf {\large \\ Course Description:} Using the DTrace system
students explore the various sub-systems of a modern operating system,
including the scheduler, memory management, networking and storage.
Each class introduces a new topic from a basic theoretical standpoint,
and then works through several practical examples in which
applications interact with the operating system.  Students will write
scripts during their lab and homework sessions to investigate and
answer questions about how each subsystem is reacting when presented
with common applications, such as a web server or database.  The use
of tracing allows us to cover a broad range of topics in a single
week.

% Course Policies. These are just examples, modify to your liking.
\textbf {\large Course Policies:}
\begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf {General}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Computers are not to be used unless instructed to do so.
%   \item Quizzes and exams are closed book, closed notes.
%   \item \textbf {No makeup quizzes or exams will be given.}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item \textbf {Grades}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Grades in the \textbf{C} range represent performance that \textbf{meets expectations}; Grades in the \textbf{B} range represent performance that is \textbf{substantially better} than the expectations; Grades in the \textbf{A} range represent work that is \textbf{excellent}.
%   \item Grades will be maintained in the LMS course shell. Students are responsible for tracking their progress by referring to the online gradebook.
%   \end{itemize}
\item \textbf {Labs and Assignments}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Students are expected to work independently. \textbf{Offering}
    and \textbf{accepting} solutions from others is an act of
    \textbf{plagiarism}, which is a serious offense and \textbf{all
      involved parties will be penalized according to the Academic
      Honesty Policy}. Discussion amongst students is encouraged, but
    when in doubt, direct your questions to the professor, tutor, or
    lab assistant.
  \item \textbf{No late assignments will be accepted under any circumstances}.
  \end{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Attendance and Absences}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Attendance is expected and will be taken each class. You are
%     allowed to miss \textbf{1} class during the semester without
%     penalty. Any further absences will result in point and/or grade
%     deductions.
%   \item Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of
%     the reason for absence. It is also the absentee's responsibility
%     to get all missing notes or materials.
%  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
